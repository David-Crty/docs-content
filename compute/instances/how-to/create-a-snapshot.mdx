The snapshot feature lets you create a backup of a specific [volume](/compute/instances/concepts/#volumes) of your Instance. A snapshot is a full-volume copy stored in our secure data centers. They are usually used to recover volume data or to create a copy of a volume.

<Message type="note">

The snapshot features creates backups of specific volumes only. If you wish to create a backup image which is a complete backup of your Instance including **all** of its volumes, consider using the [backup feature](/compute/instances/how-to/create-a-backup)

## How to create a snapshot

A snapshot takes a picture of a specific volume at one point in time. Creating snapshots of your volumes gives you total freedom of which volumes you want to back up, while images are more convenient for full backups of your Instance.  
A unified snapshot can be used to create either a BSSD or LSSD volume.

* **LSSD:** Choose this snapshot type to be able to create another local volume from your snapshot. Learn more
* **Unified:** Choose this snapshot type to be able to create either a local or block volume from your snapshot.

1. Click **Instances** in the **Compute** section of the side menu. The Instances page displays.

2. Click the **Snapshots** tab.

3. Click the **+ Create a snapshot** button. You are directed to the snapshot creation wizard.

4. Complete the following steps in the wizard: 
    - Choose a **name** for the snapshot, or use the default suggested name.
    - Select the **volume** you wish to snapshot. All of your Instances' volumes will be shown on the drop-down list, grouped by Availability Zone.
    - Select the snapshot type. Snapshots can either be of LSSD or Unified type.
    - Check the **Estimated Cost**.

5. Click **Create a new snapshot** to finish. You are redirected to the **Snapshots** tab, where your new snapshot now appears in the list.

## How to create a volume from a snapshot

You can create a [volume](/compute/instances/concepts/#volume) from a snapshot as follows:

1. Click **Instances** in the **Compute** section of the side menu. The Instances page displays.

2. Click the **Snapshots** tab.

3. Click <Icon name="more" /> next to the snapshot you want to create an image from. A drop-down menu displays.

4. Click **Volume from snapshot**. A pop-up displays.

  <Lightbox src="scaleway-volume-from-snapshot.webp" alt="" />

5. Enter a name for the volume (or use the default suggested name), and click **Create Volume from Snapshot**

6. Click **Create image from snapshot**. 

The volume is created, and can be viewed in the [Volumes tab](https://console.scaleway.com/instance/volumes). Check out our documentation on [attaching volumes](/storage/block/how-to/attach-a-volume) and [mounting volumes](/storage/block/how-to/mount-and-use-volume) to learn how to use the volume with your Instances.

## How to create an Instance from a snapshot

Follow the instructions for [creating an Instance](/compute/instances/how-to/create-an-instance). At the **Choose an Image** step of the creation wizard, click the **My Snapshots** tab, and select the desired snapshot.

<Lightbox src="scaleway-create-from-snapshot.webp" alt="" />

You can see the snapshotted volume in the Instance's volumes at step 4 of the creation wizard.
